# Project2
// it was Jim Rhow who once said, finish your day before you start, finish your week before you start, finish your month before you start, when he was talkimg about planning, having a to do list and writing everything down on paper before we start the day.


//it is a good practice but it is hard sometimes to follow these step so as a programmer i am going to make an app that will make it easier for user to plan their day

//i will create a app where user can add a list of to do list, and be able to mark it as done, edit it or delete it once they dont need it anymore.

// i will also add some quote and bible verse to keep them motivated!
